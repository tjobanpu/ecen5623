interrupts that call services\\
blocking vs interference:\\
interference is just simply a lower priority thread getting preempted.\\
blocking is when your thread or process is waiting on a resource.\\

Dm sufficient feasibility:
\[\frac{C_i}{D_i}+\frac{I_i}{D_i}<1.0\]

Blocking types:\\
bounded: take into consideration in execution times\\
unbounded: can't take into account.\\


deadlock and priority inversion.\\

deadlock: unbounded\\

watchdog timer: hardware which needs to be reset, look it up\\

unbounded blocking is the real problem\\

this is what we get when task a wants sem x and task b wants sem y.\\



other situation is priority inversion.\\
priorities getting inverted because the higher priority task depends on the lower one.\\
need 3 or more for this to happen.\\
