\section*{Lecture}
CPU Scheduling Overview\\
3 fundamental resources are processor, i/o, and memory.\\

Fair vs Unfair scheduling.\\
need a programmable interval timer interrupt for fair scheduling.\\
fair scheduling doesn't provide a predictable response.\\

other option is to prempt and run to completion.\\

Flynn's Taxonomy\\


Scheduling Taxonomy tree looks cool.\\

elements of scheduling class.\\
scheduling policies: cooperative, preemptive, non-preemptive\\
sheduling feasibility: can your scheduler work given available resources.\\
tunability?: if actual differs from expected what can you do?\\

simple scheduling prediction=pessimistic\\

WCET = Worst Case Execution Time\\

Typical RTOS Scheduling Policies:\\
Single processor, fixed priority Preemptive or dynamic preemptive.\\
Rate monotonic feasibility test (Least Upper Bound (LUB))\\
other test: scheduling point algorithm, complpetion test algorithm (over least common multiple (LCM) periods)\\

task is an implemenation of a service\\
task control block (TCB)\\
dispatcher running\\
dispatch forces a context switch\\


RTOS local preemptive\\
Fixed priority RTOS rate monotonic\\
advantages: deterministic latency, well established, predictable overload failure, can get 100\% theoretically, RM LUB 70\%, knowon latency/throughput tuning methods\\
disadvantages: RM LUB is pessimistic, requires preemption overhead (interrupts, context switch), can be complex for global-multi processor architectures (load balanacing, asymmetric service allocation, message passing overhead)\\

local preemptive with dynamic priority\\
advantages: 100 utilization and high throughput\\
disadvantages: hard, Least latency first(LLF) is easier thand easiest deadline first(EDF), catastrophic failure can occur\\

compared to linux/unix style RR/time slice\\
advantages: best effor fair, everbody gets a slice\\
disadvantages: do we care about fairness? huge overhead on quantum preemption and context switch\\

Why use an RTOS?\\
common scheduling framework for:\\
fixed priority preemptive (Rate monotonic, deadline monotonic), dynamic priority preemptive (EDF, LLF), Non-preemptive cooperative (multi-frequency executive, dataflow)\\
what else: filesystems, memory, context switching, communication, ectetera\\

Real time service types:\\
types: hard real time, soft RT, Best effort, isochronal hard real time (digital feedback control systems), isochronal soft real-time (continuous media, vidio, audio)\\
Isochronal definition here: the deadline can't be early or late has to be right on time.\\

real time service types in terms of utility\\
Utility curve, value/harm of response over time.\\

Issues beyond policy and feasibility\\
Latency control: do you allow deadline over-runs, shutdown when deadline is missed?\\
Dealing with Non-determinism: Do we always have to assume worst case (WCET, Shortest period(worst case release frequency)), when have we tested enough to verify worst case assumptions?\\
overhead: lump it into worst case? ignore it?\\
