\section*{Test Review}
Chapter 11 again lol\\
Cameras for exercise 4.\\
final project can't use freeRTOS apparently.\\
exam stuff\\

things I got wrong:\\
When a pthread\_mutex\_timedlock is used, an absolute time is used not a relative

wait on a resource is sigwait not pthread\_mutex\_unlock\\
pending to ready is pthread\_mutex\_unlock not sigwait.\\

RM derivation:\\
I=the floor of $\frac{T2}{T1}$, not the ceil you dope\\
$f=\frac{T2}{T1}-\lfloor \frac{T2}{T1}\rfloor$.\\

you didn't give an RM service set that had zero-margin, you gave something that wasn't full utility.\\
