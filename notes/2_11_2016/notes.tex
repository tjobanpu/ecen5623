Getting caught up because of basically 2 missed days.\\


moar RM LUB.

case 1: c1 short enough to fit all 3 releases in $T_2$ (fits S2 critical time zone).\\
case 2: c1 too large to fit last release in $T_2$ (doesn't fit S2 critical time zone).\\
examine both and we can find a common upper bound.\\

two bounds and their intersection creates the LUB.\\
Utility isn't dependent on computation time here strictly because of previous assumptions.\\

why not use EDF all the time?\\
excess computation.\\
