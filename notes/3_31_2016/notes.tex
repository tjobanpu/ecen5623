Jetson TK-1 multi-core CPU and a GPU\\
Intel Mica (Many integrated core architecture)\\

i/o interfaces. 10/100 is ethernet.\\

why did we switch from parallel to serial\\
cost and signal integrity.\\

different types of i/o:
\begin{itemize}
    \item word based for registers, and low i/o interfaces
    \item Block: for fifos, dual port ram, dMA high rate i/o
    \item system memory map: boot big busses
\end{itemize}

ethernet has a header and src\\
nagle algorithm is forceably used by ethernet.\\

need a driver to access memory. Need to tell MMU to reference driver which will present the device as a block of memory to write to.\\

ram at 0.\\


Test will be on
